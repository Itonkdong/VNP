83,"Ripe and forward in blackberry and cherry jam, this Sangiovese-based blend (with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot) is a simple wine to drink with burgers.",0
53,"Wild flower, dried jasmine, wild berry, hazelnut and ginger open the beautifully fragrant bouquet. The mouthfeel is tight, elegant and silky with polished tannins and fresh menthol overtones. Give this wine 10 more years.",1
70,"This is the winery's best new Pinot Noir. Essentially a barrel selection, using different clones from multiple sites in the estate vineyard, it's spicy and dry, with complex flavors of raspberry and cherry tart, Dr. Pepper, spice, sandalwood and anise, as well as a hint of mushroomy funk. Enjoy now–2015.",1
45,"A wonderful Sauvignon Blanc, bone dry and tartly crisp, with mouthwatering flavors of lemons, limes, grapefruits, minerals, vanilla and peppery spices. Entirely unoaked, it's a fine cocktail sipper, and great with savory little appetizers.",0
44,"The wine made good use of wood, giving mint flavors while not overtaking the black-currant fruitiness. Structured behind the fruit, it is balanced with an attractive burst of acidity at the end. Drink from 2018.",0
39,"The blend on this complex red wine is mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with some Petit Verdot and what the winery calls “other reds.” It's the most interesting of Geyser Peak's 2011s, showing ripe, forward black cherry and red currant fruit, but also notes of dried herbs, minerals, bacon, black pepper, licorice and espresso. While it's not an ager, it grows more interesting as it breathes in the glass.",1
22,"Mortar and a taste of black-olive tapenade ride softly layered waves of leathery tannin and peppery clove in this richly balanced wine that features tension between notes of cedar and cured meat. Focused and full bodied, it'll do well in the cellar; drink now through 2023.",1
80,"Grapes from this tiny AVA frequently deliver that something extra that catapults Pinot into a higher dimension. Here, solid cherry and berry tones bear almost indefinable traces of iron, mineral and sweet hay. Delicious already, this should continue to improve through 2020.",1
10,"Pomegranate and cranberry aromas gain complexity from wet slate and wild-thyme touches. The palate blends tangy fruit with earthy herbs, showing sage, dill, Earl Gray tea and fennel against a dried berry backdrop.",1
0,"Translucent in color, silky in the mouth, this Mendocino-grown Pinot shows ripe, forward flavors and crisp acidity. You'll find pie-filling cherries and rhubarb, with a cola and root beer soda finish.",0
18,"Black licorice and orange zest star in this high-toned wine from a singular clone. It's moderate in acidity, with a strong presence of fresh lemon that lingers through the finish.",1
30,"Delicious and succulent, a gigantic Zinfandel. Impresses for the powerful ripeness of the blackberry, plum and cherry fruit, accented with waves of smoky wood, cocoa and Asian spices. The tannins are rich and strong. Will age for a long time, gradually losing density and becoming softer and sweeter.",1
73,"Struck flint and tomato leaf notes add welcome complexity to this wine's grapefruit aromas and flavors. For a wild-ferment Sauvignon Blanc, it's reasonably clean, with moderate body and a long, dry finish.",1
33,"This is a ripe wine with prune, raisin, coconut and cedar-sawdust aromas. Dense in the mouth, with giant tannins, this dry-farmed bear features sun-baked, slightly stewed flavors of berry fruits along with minty oak. A hard-driving finish is woody and tannic. Drink through 2018.",0
90,"A rare Petit Verdot from Washington, very dark and smoky, with earth, herb, a smooth palate, and ripe tannins. This is more terroir-driven than varietally “correct” – a bit of green tea flavor comes in with the tannins, but overall everything is nicely managed.",0
4,"Think of Subsídio as a contribution rather than as a subsidy, says the producer—in this case a contribution to a meal. The wine is soft and fully ripe. It has generous tannins and black fruits. The rich wine, with its juicy aftertaste, is ready to drink.",0
76,"Luscious stone-fruit notes on the nose suggest ripeness and opulence. The palate speaks with that same generous fruit but holds a tight fresh grip that unites mirabelle, crisp green apple, bright citrus and yeasty richness. This is a beautifully balanced expressive wine with fine creamy fizz that is lovely now but will also reward laying down. The finish is long and deliciously dry and fresh. Drink 2017–2022.",1
77,"Aged nine months in 20% new French oak, this enjoyable offering brings notes of cedar, cranberry and cola. True to the vintage, the flavors are richer in style while still retaining acidity with firm, tightly coiled tannins and a mesquite filled finish. Drinking young right now, hide this one away in the cellar for a while.",0
12,"From the Kellerberg vineyard, this is a powerfully rich wine, with its cream and nutmeg flavors complemented by creamed baked apples. There is strong pepper and spice character here.",1
31,"For sheer voluptuous pleasure, this is one of Williams Sel-yem's best 2010s. It just floods the mouth with flavors of raspberry and cherry Pop-Tarts, with the most wonderful array of spices and a tender use of oak. Hard to keep from drinking it now, but it should age well over the next 8–10 years.",1
