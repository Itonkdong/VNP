0,"Translucent in color, silky in the mouth, this Mendocino-grown Pinot shows ripe, forward flavors and crisp acidity. You'll find pie-filling cherries and rhubarb, with a cola and root beer soda finish.",0
1,"On the palate, this wine is rich and complex, with flavors of dried cherry, cola, licorice, red currant and sandalwood that finish bone dry. It has lots of acidity and some sandpaper-like tannins. This should begin to develop bottle-age notes after 2016.",1
2,"The producer blends 57% Chardonnay from the Maldonado Vineyard with 39% Sauvignon Blanc and 4% Viognier for this fresh, floral white. On the palate, apple and lemon flavors are buttressed by a core of laser-like acidity. A fresh pear note lasts long into the finish, proving the wine's ability to be both creamy and crisp.",1
3,"Pure Baga in all its glory, packed with dry and dark tannins and a brooding character that is mitigated by the rich dark plum and blackberry jelly flavors. It's a wine that is probably at its peak, still with its tannins and structure although now with rich fruits and intense final acidity. Drink now and until 2022.",1
4,"Think of Subsídio as a contribution rather than as a subsidy, says the producer—in this case a contribution to a meal. The wine is soft and fully ripe. It has generous tannins and black fruits. The rich wine, with its juicy aftertaste, is ready to drink.",0
5,"Watermelon, cantaloupe and peach aromas are just as they should be, while the palate is whole, fresh and full of tangerine and nectarine. Compact, defined and complete, with a smooth, light finish. Nothing miraculous but great for summer sipping.",0
6,"There is an important element of wood here, along with a ripe, creamy texture. By contrast, the structure is mineral, lifted with grapefruit flavors. The wood supports this fruit, giving a complete, mouth filling wine.",1
7,"Fresh and straightforward on the nose, with tropical fruit aromas. The palate is pulpy but good, with flavors of fruit punch and melon. Turns a little sweet and pithy on the finish, but holds it together. Perfectly good for the price.",0
8,"Peach and a hint of fresh lettuce are the key aromas to a basic bouquet. This feels solid but pithy, while orange and other generic citrus flavors turn slightly bitter on the finish.",0
9,"This wine's incredibly distinct nose of pure fruit shows plump raspberries alongside delicate grapeseed, a pinch of baking spice and a whiff of yeast. Though the wine is light in color and frame, the palate shows lots of earth, tobacco smoke, cherry pits, bouquet garni and rosemary, with refreshing wild berry fruit.",1
10,"Pomegranate and cranberry aromas gain complexity from wet slate and wild-thyme touches. The palate blends tangy fruit with earthy herbs, showing sage, dill, Earl Gray tea and fennel against a dried berry backdrop.",0
11,"With 20 acres—the smallest of the Margaux classified growths—Ferrière has produced a 2010 of considerable weight and structure. It's dark and serious, with a solid flavor of black plum skin and dense acidity on the finish. Keep this wine for at least seven years for it to start softening.",1
12,"From the Kellerberg vineyard, this is a powerfully rich wine, with its cream and nutmeg flavors complemented by creamed baked apples. There is strong pepper and spice character here.",1
13,This is both fruity and deliciously crisp. It has the light touch of the vintage—red fruits attractively balancing with the acidity and the tangy lemon edge. The aftertaste is both fruity and herbal. Drink now.,0
14,"Still young and fruity, this wine is totally integrated, harmoniously blending the red fruits with a tight texture and fresh acidity. Although it is drinkable now, it will benefit from bottle age, so best drink from 2017.",1
15,"What a clean, pretty fruit-and-flowers nose this has, and theflavors don't disappoint. Melon and citrus dominate, but it's all ripe fruit and not the least bit lean. The tail end is lengthy and layered, if maybe a bit chalky. But all in all this wine delivers the goods with a smile.",0
16,"Toast and mocha scents and flavors surround a core of tart red berries. More barrel influence comes out as the wine breathes—clove, spice and smoke—as it rolls into a tightly-wrapped, tannic finish. Give this a lot of aeration, or tuck it away for another five or six years.",1
17,"This limestone-reared wine aspires to be a Chardonnay leader in Chile, but so far its track record lags behind its desires. This version smells minerally like a multivitamin, but not fruity. A blocky palate is oily in texture, while this tastes briny and of sour citrus and stone fruits. A savory finish tastes oaky and muddled.",0
18,"Black licorice and orange zest star in this high-toned wine from a singular clone. It's moderate in acidity, with a strong presence of fresh lemon that lingers through the finish.",0
19,"The aromas of fresh herbs, tobacco and barrel spice seem quite locked-up at present on this dark purple-colored wine. The full-bodied dark fruit flavors and lightly chewy tannins show a mix of grace and power.",1
20,"Aromas of crushed dark-skinned berry, violet, clove and a hint of chopped herb lead the nose. The lean palate offers raw raspberry, sour cherry and ground pepper alongside firm tannins. A note of bitter walnut closes the finish.",0
21,"This complex and distinctive wine is dark and brooding, and reveals itself reluctantly through an elaborate overlay of well-toasted oak. Below all that char and vanilla is polished blackcurrant and cassis fruit. The sweet tannins and weight of the wine are pedigreed, but there's a rawness that demands cellaring. Best beyond 2008.",1
22,"Mortar and a taste of black-olive tapenade ride softly layered waves of leathery tannin and peppery clove in this richly balanced wine that features tension between notes of cedar and cured meat. Focused and full bodied, it'll do well in the cellar; drink now through 2023.",1
23,"An assertive oak influence gives this full-bodied wine a cedar and pencil shavings aroma. On the palate ripe black cherry flavors mingle with more spicy, perfumed oak elements. It's quite tannic, but the ripe fruit and oak seem to balance out the astringency in a way that will make it a great match with rich, meaty dishes.",0
24,"Dominated by Merlot and Cabernet Franc, typical of this region to the east of Saint-Emilion, this is a ripe, smooth wine, its tannins spread through the fresh red fruit flavors. There's lively acidity here as well, a wine whose tannins promise aging.",0
25,"With its great richness, the wine is opulent, generous and full of powerful fruits. The wood aging and the toastiness have done nothing to diminish the yellow fruit and crisp apple flavors. It's an impressive and concentrated wine that will age for many years. Drink from 2020.",1
26,"Expansive, round and supple in the mouth, this Shiraz features lush raspberry fruit, framed by vanilla oak. There's a tart edge to the finish, providing a solid sense of balance to the lingering warm, chocolaty notes. Drink now.",0
27,"Foresty plum and berry aromas are spunky and more high toned than dense. This Malbec is fresh with smacking tannins. Lightly herbal berry flavors convey an Old World sense, while this finishes with developed spice and oaky maple notes. Drink through 2024.",1
28,"This southern Italian blend of Gaglioppo and Cabernet Sauvignon opens with soft aromas of ripe blackberry, espresso, dark chocolate and spice. There's a note of sweet cherry on the finish, followed by smoothly polished tannins. The wine is elegant and clean.",0
29,"There's a pretty floral character to the bouquet of this wine—think rose and honeysuckle—framing the ripe peach, apricot and orange fruit tones. Those notes continue through to the medium-weight palate, with ample acidity to cut through the rich fruit flavors and slight viscosity of the finish.",0
30,"Delicious and succulent, a gigantic Zinfandel. Impresses for the powerful ripeness of the blackberry, plum and cherry fruit, accented with waves of smoky wood, cocoa and Asian spices. The tannins are rich and strong. Will age for a long time, gradually losing density and becoming softer and sweeter.",0
31,"For sheer voluptuous pleasure, this is one of Williams Sel-yem's best 2010s. It just floods the mouth with flavors of raspberry and cherry Pop-Tarts, with the most wonderful array of spices and a tender use of oak. Hard to keep from drinking it now, but it should age well over the next 8–10 years.",1
32,Touches of rum cake and licorice lend this 60-40 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot an impression of intensity and persistence. The wine delivers flavors of blackberry and candied cherry.,0
33,"This is a ripe wine with prune, raisin, coconut and cedar-sawdust aromas. Dense in the mouth, with giant tannins, this dry-farmed bear features sun-baked, slightly stewed flavors of berry fruits along with minty oak. A hard-driving finish is woody and tannic. Drink through 2018.",0
34,"Aged more than two years in air-dried French oak, this is classic Oakville Cabernet Sauvignon, velvety and plush. It boasts juicy blackberry and black cherry fruit aromas and flavors, with weighty oak and a mix of coconut flake and chocolate that linger on the finish.",1
35,"Powerful and structured, this offers both the weight and the potential for rich fruit. Dominated at this stage by tannins and wood-influenced flavors, the black plum note is likely to come through in the next year. The acidity is crisp, and a bitter cherry character flavors the finish.",0
36,"Initially this smells oaky, pasty and lactic, but with time it opens to reveal blackberry and cassis aromas. The palate is lively and offers healthy acidic cut. Flavors of creamy berry, oak and plum end with a creamy feeling and lightly lactic tasting finish. Overall this is a polished wine with minimal varietal character.",0
37,"This bright passito dessert wine delivers a steady stream of apricot, honey, almond and candy-like aromas. The wine is thick, syrupy and ends with a fresh note of citrus zest.",0
38,"This is a young, soft and fruity wine, with ripe black fruits that are lightly textured by the dry, spicy core. With some wood aging, the wine has a toasty accent and a smooth character that makes it ready to drink now.",0
39,"The blend on this complex red wine is mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with some Petit Verdot and what the winery calls “other reds.” It's the most interesting of Geyser Peak's 2011s, showing ripe, forward black cherry and red currant fruit, but also notes of dried herbs, minerals, bacon, black pepper, licorice and espresso. While it's not an ager, it grows more interesting as it breathes in the glass.",1
40,"The blend is Grenache Blanc, Roussanne and Picpoul Blanc, grown at a high altitude on Paso Robles's west side. The wine is dense and concentrated in apricots, oranges and mangoes, balanced with acidity and sweet oak. With a dry finish, it's a complex wine to drink now.",0
41,"Enticing aromas of citrus, spring blossom and white stone fruit set the tone on this elegant sparkler. Bright and polished, the silky palate offers Bartlett pear and green apple alongside vibrant acidity and a silky perlage.",1
42,"Whiffs of crushed slate and smoke add earthy complexity to sweet yellow-peach and pink-grapefruit flavors in this delicate but composed Auslese. Intensely minerally on the palate, it finishes with a fresh, green, floral flair and piercing citrus acidity.",1
43,"Stephan von Neipperg of Château Canon la Gaffelière was an early proponent of Castillon vineyard potential and chose this property which is on the same ridge as Saint-Emilion. Fruity and ripe, this is a generous wine. Finely structured tannins back up the black-currant fruits and give the wine a texture that bodes well for the future. Drink from 2019.",1
44,"The wine made good use of wood, giving mint flavors while not overtaking the black-currant fruitiness. Structured behind the fruit, it is balanced with an attractive burst of acidity at the end. Drink from 2018.",0
45,"A wonderful Sauvignon Blanc, bone dry and tartly crisp, with mouthwatering flavors of lemons, limes, grapefruits, minerals, vanilla and peppery spices. Entirely unoaked, it's a fine cocktail sipper, and great with savory little appetizers.",0
46,"Aromas of pear and anise pace the nose of this medium-bodied wine. It's a simple, fruit-cocktail-like sipper, with a quick, easy finish and a reasonable price tag. Drink now.",0
47,"There's a very cooked quality to this bottling, with aromas of kirsch, stewed cherry, grape juice, coffee and strong violets. Somewhat sweeter flavors of strawberry, plum and cocoa dust show on the sip, held up by decent acidity.",0
48,"Simple and linear, this has a mixed berry aroma, with notes of licorice, leather and dried tobacco. It's plush, fresh and shows power on the finish.",0
49,Simaens has produced a ripe style of wine here. Apple and rich citrus flavors add a delicious touch to tropical fruit flavors. This wine is fit for drinking in the next few months.,0
50,"Dark strawberry mixes with allspice, incense and a touch of smoke on this wine's nose. Purple-flower flavors of lavender and violet mix with black raspberry, dried sage, ginger and black tea, all wrapped up in tart plum-peel tension.",0
51,"This 100% varietal wine hails from a site east of Cloverdale, in a warm pocket reaching up to 1,030-feet in elevation. It offers a full-bodied concentration of black cherry, raspberry and clove flavor, with a smooth texture and mild, toasty oak. Chocolate mocha marks the finish.",1
52,"This wine boasts a creamy palate, with aromas of fresh and baked apples that transition to flavors of apple crumble laced with citrus zest. Concentration, precision and lively acidity mean that this will pair well with many fatty foods. It's glorious now, but its acidity means that you can expect pleasant development over the next five years.",1
53,"Wild flower, dried jasmine, wild berry, hazelnut and ginger open the beautifully fragrant bouquet. The mouthfeel is tight, elegant and silky with polished tannins and fresh menthol overtones. Give this wine 10 more years.",1
54,"Slight hint of sulfur at first, but it blows off and the nose opens to reveal a rich medley of ripe orchard fruit tinged with dried tarragon and savory spice. Crisp, bright and laden with a patchwork of flavors: ripe apples, pears and stone fruit against a backdrop of earthy minerality. Broad yet only medium bodied, with a moderately long finish.",0
55,"Oregon is loaded with inexpensive Pinot Noirs these days, but very few are estate grown and carry the Willamette Valley AVA. Pretty and aromatic with engaging scents of cherries and cream, this has immediate appeal. Drink with pork, poultry, salmon and salads—this is your go-to, anytime bottle.",0
56,"Massively fruity and oaky, this is an atom bomb of a Chardonnay. You either love this style or you hate it. The pineapple tart, apricot, pear, peach, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice flavors go on and on. Beyond the utter richness is firm acidity and a bracing minerality. Defines California-style decadence, but drink now, as the wine will quickly go downhill.",1
57,"This old-vines wine is really clean and light on the nose, with aromas of red apple, fresh-cut white sapote and blanched almonds. The laser-focused palate is dominated by a refreshing texture, like sipping an ice-cold martini or licking a steel knife, with sea salt and lemon peel flavors most prevalent.",1
58,"A blend of four varieties, this is a full-bodied, plush-textured wine with easy-to-like fruit and spice flavors and a lingering finish.",0
59,"Stiff tannins are matched to sharp raspberry and boysenberry fruit, crafting a well-defined, young and potent wine. This may benefit from another year or two in bottle, but it's already a tasty, albeit tight wine with a mix of fresh fruit and astringent, herb and cracker flavors.",0
60,"Santo is a creamy Moscato d'Asti with ripe fruit aromas of yellow rose, honey and apricot. The wine shows a thick, bold style ,with an off-gold color and plenty of sweetness on the sticky finish.",0
61,"This is a wine that's full of blackberry flavor, with elegant fruitiness and sweet tannins. It may miss the firm structure of the vintage, but it makes up for that with its forward, ripe fruitiness.",1
62,"Blue fruit and high acidity open this delightful Pinot Noir, from a cool section of the Russian River Valley overlapping Green Valley. The oak imprint is low, yet the wine offers firm structure and elegance, remaining subdued and fresh on the palate in swirls of dark cherry, boysenberry and earthy leather.",0
63,"Surprisingly rich and complex for this price and the statewide appellation, a full-bodied wine with glorious flavors of blackcurrants. Coats the mouth and lasts through a long finish. The tannins are soft and intricate and add to the enjoyment.",0
64,"This tremendous wine is 100% Pinot Grigio, of which 50% was aged in new wood. It is rich and full-bodied, with complex layers of vanilla. It comes from low-yielding, old vines. Only 8,000 bottles were produced.",1
65,"The intriguing golden-pink color looks like sun shining through a rose petal, and the aromas of honey, buttered popcorn and pecan pie are just as appealing. Once sipped, the flavors of poached salmon somehow show. These continue into a long finish, although the acidity soon wipes the slate clean like a good rosé should. This is one of many wines made by ninth-generation Santa Maria Valleyite James Ontiveros.",1
66,"The scent of fresh Bosc pear peel also conveys a sense of texture. This is confirmed on the rounded, juicy and full-fruited palate that balances the generous ripe pear with ample, off-dry freshness. Drink soon for maximum enjoyment of fruit.",0
67,"This wine's grapefruit and lemon flavors are lean, showing too much tartness and heat.",0
68,"The equivalent of an alternative second wine from Château Pichon Baron (with Les Tourelles), Les Griffons is named after the statues of griffins that are in the chateau's courtyard. This is a structured wine, firmly tannic while already showing plenty of black currant fruitiness. Equal measures of Merlot and Cabernet balance the wine and give depth of flavor. It will develop soon and will be drinkable from 2017.",1
69,"Part of the same family business as Philippe Girard's wines (Benoît is his brother), this is a ripe, pure and clean wine. Perfumed acidity and zesty flavors are integrated into the rich green fruit. Apples and green plums dominate this refreshing wine that will develop. Drink from 2017.",0
70,"This is the winery's best new Pinot Noir. Essentially a barrel selection, using different clones from multiple sites in the estate vineyard, it's spicy and dry, with complex flavors of raspberry and cherry tart, Dr. Pepper, spice, sandalwood and anise, as well as a hint of mushroomy funk. Enjoy now–2015.",1
71,"A beautifully drinkable rosé sparkling wine for opening now. It's soft and honeyed, with fine bubbles framing slightly sweet flavors of raspberries, cherries, brioche, vanilla and toast.",0
72,"The wine still tastes young, with ripe yellow fruits and bright acidity. Chardonnay dominates the blend, allowing hints of minerality to come through the lime and lemon crispness. Still developing its more toasty character, it will be better from 2017.",1
73,"Struck flint and tomato leaf notes add welcome complexity to this wine's grapefruit aromas and flavors. For a wild-ferment Sauvignon Blanc, it's reasonably clean, with moderate body and a long, dry finish.",0
74,"With fruit harvested from the beautiful Brunate cru located just a short distance away from the Barolo castle, this wine from Marcarini will delight you. The aromas here are full, generous and recall wild berry, cedar, smoke, licorice and cherry cola. Tight, firm tannins and bright acidity make the wine both cellar worthy and food friendly.",1
75,"Made in a full-bodied style with a density of firm tannins, this wine offers a mix of ripe black cherry and black licorice notes, the core succulent and strong.",0
76,"Luscious stone-fruit notes on the nose suggest ripeness and opulence. The palate speaks with that same generous fruit but holds a tight fresh grip that unites mirabelle, crisp green apple, bright citrus and yeasty richness. This is a beautifully balanced expressive wine with fine creamy fizz that is lovely now but will also reward laying down. The finish is long and deliciously dry and fresh. Drink 2017–2022.",1
77,"Aged nine months in 20% new French oak, this enjoyable offering brings notes of cedar, cranberry and cola. True to the vintage, the flavors are richer in style while still retaining acidity with firm, tightly coiled tannins and a mesquite filled finish. Drinking young right now, hide this one away in the cellar for a while.",0
78,"Made to appeal to the modern taste for sweetness, this blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Viognier is simple in jammy apricot, citrus and tropical fruit flavors. It has bright acidity, which helps balance it.",0
79,"From the Treviso area of the Veneto, this fragrant and floral Moscato sparkling wine offers sweet and chewy tones of peach syrup and ripe fruit.",0
80,"Grapes from this tiny AVA frequently deliver that something extra that catapults Pinot into a higher dimension. Here, solid cherry and berry tones bear almost indefinable traces of iron, mineral and sweet hay. Delicious already, this should continue to improve through 2020.",1
81,"Fat aromas of black cherry, cassis, caramel, oak and vanilla quickly pull the nose into this blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Merlot and 7% Petite Sirah. The exuberance is dialed back on the sip, where tart black-plum skin, roast beef and pepper spice flavors abound.",1
82,"Smooth beyond its youthful age, this is sparked to life with peppery highlights dappling a pretty, cherry-candy fruit core. Lighter accents of cola and cocoa follow up through a medium-long finish.",0
83,"Ripe and forward in blackberry and cherry jam, this Sangiovese-based blend (with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot) is a simple wine to drink with burgers.",0
84,"With fruit drawn from all over Burgundy, this is a light, bright and refreshing wine. It has light acidity, spice and apple flavors and a bright, tight aftertaste. Drink now.",0
85,"Full in the mouth, this is a ripe, currant- and gooseberry-flavored wine. It has a bright, forward, fruity feel that makes it delicious to drink. Very refreshing in character. Screwcap.",0
86,"Newsome-Harlow's Shake Ridge is true to its famous Foothills vineyard source year after year and 2009 is no exception. The wine is a little muted at first, gamey even, with looming, site-specific, tarry structure. Give it a rest and it should open up in beautiful ways, its big, blueberry bones impeccably tamed.",1
87,"A fabulously rich and approachable Pinot Noir that offers everything now, yet will also age. The considerable tannins will protect it in the cellar for a good 6–8 years, but it's so fresh and vibrant in cherries, red currants and oak-inspired red licorice that it's hard not to drink it now. Hard to exaggerate the deliciousness factor.",1
88,"Notions of ripe lemon and mandarin zest play upon nose and palate of this admirably dry Riesling, which has enough concentration to carry the riot of citrus perfectly. This refreshing, clean and bracing wine could be your rescue on a hot summer day.",0
89,"This wine presents itself initially as having a bold, big body, yet is actually light on its feet as it opens, revealing aromas of cherry liqueur, rhubarb joined with a funk of black licorice and sassafras.",0
90,"A rare Petit Verdot from Washington, very dark and smoky, with earth, herb, a smooth palate, and ripe tannins. This is more terroir-driven than varietally “correct” – a bit of green tea flavor comes in with the tannins, but overall everything is nicely managed.",0
91,"Steely and mineral in character, this is a taut, nervy wine. It has great acidity and balance, with green fruit and sliced apple flavors. Keep for 3–4 years. Screwcap.",1
92,"Compared to the winery's crisp and light 2014 bottling, this oxidative, skin contact-driven style, which is golden in color, is a bit weird at first, but immediately easy to enjoy. Candied orange rinds pop off the nose, and rich dried-apple flavors show on the palate along with orange syrup, almond oil and honey. But it stays lively and fresh, making for an intriguing sip.",0
93,"This is a rich wine, soft and juicy. Superripe—perhaps overripe—fruit gives a jammy character to the wine. The core woody flavor from aging in French and American oak is prominent and needs to round out. Drink from 2017.",0
94,"Rich and ripe with cherry, pomegranate, persimmon and spice flavors, with a nice, silky texture and fine tannins. The acidity is sharp, the alcohol refreshingly moderate. Could benefit from some time in the cellar.",0
95,"Crisp and fresh, this is a light wine that is dominated by red-currant fruits. It has considerable acidity as well as tannins. Fruity while lightly perfumed, it will be ready from 2018.",0
96,"The black-cherry fruit on the nose of this wine is a little sour, lifted by coffee grinds and incense. The tip of the sip is ripe with blueberry, then hardens around stiff tannins and zingy acidity, finishing on smoke and crushed herbs.",0
97,"Corte Lenguin's Amarone is less intense aromatically and laid-back in general with measured aromas of ripe fruit, resin, tar and mesquite. It offers more in the mouth however, in terms of density and taste, with a broad texture and bright cherry flavors.",0
98,"Opulent and very minerally, this is deeply flavored and concentrated, with a lively, crisp edge. It's fruity while also having a textured finish that shows a structured, age-worthy side.",1
99,"Combined with 20% Grenache, this full-bodied, fruit-forward wine brings sweet aromas and flavors of raspberry jam and plum. Aged in mostly neutral oak, it possesses purity that carries through the finish.",0
